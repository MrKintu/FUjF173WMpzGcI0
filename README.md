Neural Network Model Evaluation and Analysis

## Contents
The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
- Model implementation and training
- Model evaluation with test accuracy and loss metrics

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- Other machine learning libraries (specific libraries to be listed based on complete notebook contents)

## Usage
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
2. Open `Assignment1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation and results

## Model Performance
The current model implementation shows:
- Test Loss: -898.792724609375
- Test Accuracy: 0.0

Note: The current metrics suggest the model might need optimization or debugging as the accuracy is unusually low.
